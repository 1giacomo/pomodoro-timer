## Overview

This is a simple Pomodoro timer built with React. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- Set custom work and break intervals
- Start, pause and reset the timer
- Display the remaining time and current interval

## Technical Details

This app was created using `npx create-react-app`, which sets up a modern React development environment with no configuration required.

## Usage

To use the Pomodoro timer, simply set your desired work and break intervals and click the start button. The timer will automatically switch between work and break intervals and display the remaining time.
